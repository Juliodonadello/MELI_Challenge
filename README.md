# Code Exercise: Predicting Item Condition (New or Used)

This repository contains a machine learning solution to predict if an item listed on MercadoLibre's marketplace is **new** or **used**. 

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of item attributes, the task is to:
1. Analyze the data and design a predictive model.
2. Evaluate the model using accuracy (minimum threshold: 0.86) and an additional secondary metric.
3. Justify the choice of features and metrics used.

## Dataset and Setup
- Dataset: `MLA_100k_checked_v3.jsonlines`
- Function for loading data: `build_dataset` in `new_or_used.py`

## Deliverables
- Scripts or notebooks with the full implementation of the model and evaluation pipeline.
- A document detailing:
  - Feature selection criteria.
  - Chosen secondary metric and its justification.
  - Performance of the model.

## Additional Details
Refer to the full problem description in the [Word document](Opportunities@MeLi%20-%20CodeExercise%20DS_ML.docx).
